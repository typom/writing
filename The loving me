Many mes live inside me.
The thinking me has great ideas
The angry me is so nasty
The dreaming me builds big cities 
But have you seen my loving me?
He lives beside my other mes
He loves them all, he loves you too
He is strong and fragile too
My loving me loves god and god loves me
My loving me, my loving me is always happy.
